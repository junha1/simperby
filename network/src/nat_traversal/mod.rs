//! A module that provides NAT traversal for the node
//! which enables the node to be able to become a server.
//!
//! TODO: based on the libp2p's NAT traversal implementation,
//! describe the interface of this module so that it can be used with
//! the DMS module.
//!
//! For example, it could be a magical function that returns a port that can be
//! immediately bound to the socket.
//! Or it could require an interactive process that asks the user to perform some
//! complicated steps to configure the network.
